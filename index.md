## Preface

Hello editor, developer, or designer! This is the homepage of the documentation for all forms of contributing to [csartisan.org](https://csartisan.org). If you are not a contributing part of the CSArtisan, this guide is of no use to you. These docs are split into multiple paths, to satisfy different levels of understanding.

This guide incorporates important rules from the Brand Guidelines, and while pulling from online guides, it is not a replica of any of them. It is recommended to only use this guide unless troubleshooting is not covered by it.

__All software linked is completely safe to use.__

***

__Easy__ is recommended for editors with little to no experience in most referenced technologies. This is the recommended path for most contributors.

__Advanced__ is for those who need specifics, either for troubleshooting or clarifying. This is not a step-by-step guide and requires prior knowledge of how to use Jekyll.
