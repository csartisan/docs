## Preface

Welcome editor, developer, or designer! This is the homepage of the documentation for all forms of contributing to [csartisan.org](csartisan.org). If you are not currently a contributor to CSArtisan, this guide may not be relevant to you. These docs are organized into multiple paths to cater to different levels of understanding.

This guide incorporates important rules from the Brand Guidelines. While it pulls from online guides, it is unique and not a replica of any of them. We recommend using this guide exclusively- unless troubleshooting is not covered here.

__All software linked is completely safe to use.__
