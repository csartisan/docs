# Markdown Editors

In this section, you will choose your Markdown editor of choice.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. 

Using Markdown is different than using a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

It doesn’t take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once you know how to use it, you can write using Markdown just about everywhere. Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown is good for formatting everything from email messages to grocery lists.

### How does Markdown work?

Markdown is a form of text file that usually uses the `.md` file format. It uses line-by-line formatting to display rich text. Every page of this very website is written in Markdown. 

Some great CSArtisan articles that use frequent Markdown formatting are [Interviewing the Endelman](https://csartisan.github.io/interviewing-the-endelman/) for its use of subheaders, and [Art Therapy](https://csartisan.github.io/art-therapy/) for its use of drop quotes. 

#### Flavor

Every platform uses different tools to display Markdown. Editors that have distinct pairings of tools are described with different "flavors" of Markdown. Basically, they are like regional dialects. It is important to pick an editor with a similar flavor to that of our website because you may not have the same formatting support from either. Here at the Artisan, we use "Jekyll Flavored" Markdown. You'll learn what that means in a little bit, so don't worry about it right now.

## Choosing a Markdown Editor

First, let's pick an editor. Each option has a list of pros and cons that will help you decide which to learn with. Once you select one, you can start learning how to write in Markdown.
